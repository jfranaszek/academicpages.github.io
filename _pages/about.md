I am an assistant professor (_adiunktka_) at the [Warsaw School of Economics](http://www.sgh.waw.pl), Department of Mathematics and Mathematical Economics. I recently did my PhD at the [European University Institute](http://www.eui.eu) under the supervision of [Piero Gottardi](http://apps.eui.eu/Personal/Gottardi/). My research is focused around information and communication theory and decision theory.

I am a part of an economic team [Dobrobyt na Pokolenia](http://napokolenia.pl). I also used to run a blog about inspiring economic papers [Hummus Œconomicus](http://hummuseconomicus.pl). In my free time, I take photos and do creative stuff with my children.
