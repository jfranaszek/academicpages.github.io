I am a fifth-year researcher in the Department of Economics at the [European University Intitute](http://www.eui.eu). My supervisor is [Piero Gottardi](http://apps.eui.eu/Personal/Gottardi/). My research is focused around information and communication theory and decision theory.

In my free time, I run a blog about inspiring economic papers [Hummus Œconomicus](http://hummuseconomicus.pl), take photos and do creative stuff with my children.
