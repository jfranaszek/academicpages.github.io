I am a fifth-year researcher at the Department of Economics in the [European University Intitute](http://www.eui.eu). My supervisor is [Piero Gottardi](http://apps.eui.eu/Personal/Gottardi/). My area of expertise in microeconomics -- in particular, information and decision theory.

In my free time, I run a blog about inspiring economic papers [Hummus Œconomicus](http://hummuseconomicus.pl) and do creative stuff with my children.
