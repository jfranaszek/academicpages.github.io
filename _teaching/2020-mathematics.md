[Lecture notes](https://jfranaszek.github.io/mat-dz/lecture_Mathematics.pdf)  

A few on-line sources I recommend:
* [Khan Academy's Calculus course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1) *probably best for your needs*
* [Eddy Woo's YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq0EGvLTyy-LLT1oUSO_0FQ) *some issues too elementary (this is a high-school course), but beautiful lectures+intuition* 
* ["Half-official" SGH list of exercises](https://web.sgh.waw.pl/~lpawel/maths.htm) 
* [one of (many) on-line resources](http://web.pdx.edu/~erdman/CALCULUS/CALCULUS_pdf.pdf)
